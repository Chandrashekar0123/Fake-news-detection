# 📰 Fake News Detection Web App

A simple yet effective **Fake News Detection** system built using **Machine Learning** and **Streamlit**. This application predicts whether a given news article is **Real** or **Fake** based on its content.

## 📌 Problem Statement

In today’s digital world, the spread of **fake news** has become a serious concern. Misinformation can influence public opinion, manipulate behavior, and cause real-world consequences. To tackle this, we need a system that can intelligently classify news articles as either genuine or fabricated using machine learning.

## 📖 Project Description

This project focuses on building a machine learning model that learns the writing patterns of both real and fake news articles and uses that learning to detect whether a new article is legitimate or not. The model is integrated into a **Streamlit web application** to provide a user-friendly interface for quick predictions.

Users simply paste any news article into the input box, and the app will classify it as either **"Real"** or **"Fake"** based on the model's output.

## 🧠 Theory (How it Works)

1. **Text Preprocessing**: The text is cleaned to remove noise like punctuation, numbers, and stop words.
2. **Feature Extraction**: A vectorizer converts text into numerical format the machine can understand.
3. **Classification**: A pre-trained **Random Forest Classifier** processes the vector and makes a prediction.
4. **Prediction Output**: The result is displayed on the web interface.
